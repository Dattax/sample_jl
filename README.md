### How it Works

Ever wondered what the Julia community is working on in industry? Us too! This is why we'd like to highlight our friends in industry, in academia, and in the open source community as a whole by throwing a friendly competition to accompany JuliaCon 2023. The goal is for you to upload your best example of using Julia's Pluto Notebook in industry to JuliaHub. 

### How to Submit

First, you _must upload the notebook on JuliaHub.com_; login to JuliaHub.com and navigate to the Pluto tab:

Once there, look for the "Add" button next to the Default folder. You can also create a new folder if desired.

To be explicit about adding your notebook to the competition, please make sure you upload it and tag it with **juliacon2023**.

We will include all notebooks submitted this way in the competition. Please submit only 1 notebook per person for this competition.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your notebook will be judged based on the following 3 categories:

1. Subject-matter: does it solve an interesting problem?
2. Presentation: how ineractive is it and what kind of output visualization does it include?
3. Package usage: how well does it use Julia Package(s) / JuliaHub ?

### Submission Criteria

Generally, we know that there are two kinds of notebooks: 

* Purely instructional notebooks (how to do something in code) - not preferred

* Interesting problems (discuss a problem and how it was solved rather than a purely instructional notebook) - preferred

## We want a project that highlights a problem that was solved

Your notebook can have an instructional element, but we care more about the results and how you present them (the notebook should be geared towards solving problems in a specific domain).

An example of a notebook that discusses a problem and provides good visualization with interactive output is: [https://gaelforget.github.io/ClimateModels.jl/dev/examples/CMIP6.html](https://juliahub.com/ui/Notebooks/fredrik-carlson2/controlsystems/analyse_robustness.jl)

### Selection Process

Our selection committee will review each submitted notebook in the month of August and announce and contact winners by the end of the month of August.
