### How it Works

Ever wondered what the Julia community is working on in industry? Us to! This is why we'd like to highlight our friends in industry, in academia, and in the open source community as a whole by throwing a friendly competition to accompany JuliaCon 2023. The goal is for you to upload your best example of using Julia's Pluto Notebook in industry to JuliaHub. 

### How to Submit

We will createa form where you can submit your static URL. The best is if you can name your project with the extension **_JuliaCon2023**

The form will ask you for the following: 

* Name of the Notebook
* JuliaHub Login Name
* Link to Notebook

We will include all notebooks submitted this way in the competition. Please submit only 1 notebook for this competition.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your notebook will be judged based on the following 3 categories:

1. Subject-matter: solves an interesting problem
2. Interactivity and includes some kind of output visualization
3. Best use of a Julia Package(s) / JuliaHub 

### Submission Criteria

* Generally, we know that there are two kinds of notebooks: 

* Instructional notebooks (how to do something)

* Interesting problems (show you how a problem was solved rather than a purely instructional notebook)

## We want a project that highlights a problem that was solved
It can have an instructional element, but we care more about the results (geared towards solving problems in a specific domain)

Need an image from Pluto itself
