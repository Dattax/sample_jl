### How it Works

Ever wondered what the Julia community is working on in industry? Us to! This is why we'd like to highlight our friends in industry, in academia, and in the open source community as a whole by throwing a friendly competition to accompany JuliaCon 2023. The goal is for you to upload your best example of using Julia's Pluto Notebook in industry to JuliaHub. 

### How to Submit

A Google Form where you can submit your static URL:

[Submit Now](https://forms.gle/QdwMiLseTDGpy8uq8)

The form will ask you for the following: 

* Name of the Notebook 
* JuliaHub Login Name
* URL Link to Notebook

We will include all notebooks submitted this way in the competition. Please submit only 1 notebook per person for this competition.

**Judging Criteria:**

Your notebook will be judged based on the following 3 categories:

1. Subject-matter: solves an interesting problem
2. Interactivity and includes some kind of output visualization
3. Best use of a Julia Package(s) / JuliaHub 

### Submission Criteria

Generally, we know that there are two kinds of notebooks: 

* Purely Instructional notebooks (how to do something in code) - not preferred

* Interesting Problems (discusses a problem and how it was solved rather than a purely instructional notebook) - preferred

## We want a project that highlights a problem that was solved

It can have an instructional element, but we care more about the results (geared towards solving problems in a specific domain)

An example of a notebook that discusses a problem and provides an output is: https://gaelforget.github.io/ClimateModels.jl/dev/examples/CMIP6.html

### Selection Process

Our selection committee will review each submitted notebook in the month of August and winners will be announced and contacted by the end of the August month.
