# Pluto Notebooks Competition

### The best Pluto Notebook projects between June 15 - August 15. 
The cutoff submission time is midnight (GST) on August 15, 2023.

### How it Works

Ever wondered what the Julia community is working on? Us to! This is why we'd like to highlight our friends in industry, in academia, and in the open source community as a whole by throwing a friendly competiion to accompony JuliaCon 2023. The goal is for you to upload your best example of using Julia in industry to JuliaHub. 

### How to Upload

You need to upload it to a JuliaHub.com account and name it **JuliaCon_P2023 - name**

We will include all notebooks marked this way in the competition.

Judging Criteria:
1. Subject-matter: solves an interesting problem
2. Interactivity and includes some kind of output visualization
3. Best use of a Julia Package(s) / JuliaHub 

### Submission Criteria

* Generally, we know that there are two kinds of notebooks: 

* Instructional notebooks (how to do something)

* Interesting problems (show you how a problem was solved rather than a purely instructional notebook)

## We want a project that highlights a problem that was solved
It can have an instructional element, but we care more about the results (geared towards solving problems in a specific domain)
